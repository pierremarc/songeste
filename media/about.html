    The HTML and CSS/Artwork varies from skin to skin. The CSS/Artwork is a designed to work with all of that skin's HTML structures. You should get the HTML structure from the demo ZIP, available on the download page. The PSD files are also available for each skin.

Accessibility
While the skin conforms with the HTML 4.01 Spec, unfortunately some browsers do not adhere to the spec. For example, Safari does not include <a> elements in the tab order. If you wish to correct this, the <a> can be replaced with <input> or <button> elements. Using these form elements requires an empty transparent GIF file to be specified for each element, which complicates use when used in dynamic web apps such as WordPress. The <input> and <button> elements also behave differently cross-browser, in particular where Internet Explorer moves the artwork down and to the right when it is clicked on. For these reason, our standard skin uses the <a> element.

The accesskey attribute may be added to each <a> element to provide access key support. The use of access keys depends on your target users. Most users do not even know how to initiate an access key and it varies from browser to browser. The key itself also needs to be conveyed to the user in some manner. Since access keys can interfere with the operation of some browsers we have not used the attribute in the default skin. After invesigation, a clearly labled link is prefered by the majority of screen reader users. ie., Our play button has the word "play" in the link, even though the text is not visible when using a standard browser.
